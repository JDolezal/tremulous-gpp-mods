The Granger Dance Mod
=====================

A granger taunting in the air (jumping, for example) near an overmind tranfers
a certain part its healh to the overmind. The amount is set in a server
variable `g_alienGrangerDanceBonus`; the default is 11. A granger cannot die
this way, if its health is too low, the dance stops working.
