Poison variations
=================
 - Touching a booster poisons a human in the same way as when bitten by a
   poisonous alien.
 - A human touching a poisoned teammate will get poisoned too (with the same duration). The idea is to make camping harder for humans - they'll transfer the poison to their camping teammates. Most likely this needs some testing and evaluation to see if it's not too anoying.
