The Granger Dance Mod
=====================

A granger taunting in the air (jumping, for example) near overmind heals
it or speeds it building by a certain amount of HP. The amount is set in
variable `GRANGER_DANCE_ADDS_HP` in g_local.h and currently it's 11.

All grangers participating in the dance get a build timer set to prevent abuse.
