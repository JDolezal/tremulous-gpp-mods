Antifeed
========
Credits/evos are not awarded right away, but released slowly over time. When a
player dies, the credit not yet released are lost. This motivates people to
stay alive, in particular, not to feed by trying to get evos/credits by
desperate suicide attacks.

The rate is controlled by variable *g_creditReleaseTime*. It holds the number
of seconds it takes to release 2000 credits or 9 evos.
