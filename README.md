A combined mod
==============

Currently contains:
 - The Granger dance;
 - Scaring/nade;
 - Disables grangers after Sudden death (with an exception when there is no OM).
 - Antifeed. Each player has to wait g_spawnLimitTime before each spawn. However, by staying alive, the player can accumulate up to g_spawnLimitBuffer spawns, which are not constrained by the limit.
